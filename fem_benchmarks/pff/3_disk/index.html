    <!-- Description Section -->
    <h2>🚀 Granite Disk Thermal-Induced Fracture</h2>
    <p>
      A benchmark example is conducted on a 2D plane strain granite disk.  
      The outer radius is \( R_{\text{out}} = 1 \) m, and the inner heated circular region has a radius of \( R_{\text{in}} = 0.2 \) m.
      The inner region has higher thermal expansion conefficient \( \alpha_{t(\text{in})} = 4.3e-5\)m/m-C than outer region \( \alpha_{t(\text{out})} = 3.5e-5\)m/m-C, and cracks are not allowed to happend in inner part!<br><br>

      The model solves three governing equations: phase field fracture (PF), mechanical equilibrium, and heat conduction equation. Their interactions are summarized as:
    </p>
    
    <p><strong>🔁 Equilibrium ↔ Heat Conduction Equation:</strong><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;• \( \mathbf{u} \) contributes to total strain \( \epsilon = \nabla^{\text{sym}}\mathbf{u} \).<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;• Temperature \( \theta \) is used to compute the trial undamaged stress \( \sigma_0 \), which is passed into the phase-field model.
    </p>
    
    <p><strong>🔁 Heat Conduction Equation ↔ Phase Field:</strong><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;• The damage variable \( d \) affects thermal conductivity \( k \), which is assumed to drop to 2% of the intact value when fully damaged.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;• In some models, the energy release rate \( G_c \) depends on \( d \) or \( \theta \), but that’s typically for high-temperature scenarios — not considered here.
    </p>
    
    <p><strong>🔁 Equilibrium ↔ Phase Field:</strong><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;• \( \mathbf{u} \) feeds into phase-field through the elastic energy \( \Psi_{\text{elastic}} \) and an additional driving force term \( c_e \).<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;• The damage field \( d \) then degrades \( \sigma_0 \) to compute the final stress \( \sigma \).

    <h2>🔑 Key Highlights</h2>
    <p>✅ <strong>Implementation of coupling system by loosely coupled setting.</strong></p>
    <p>✅ <strong>Manually established interaction between thermal and phase field systems.</strong></p>
    <p>
  ⚠️ <strong>Note 1:</strong> Any physical system is associated with a corresponding energy contribution, which can enter the phase-field fracture governing equation as part of the local driving force term. This is often written as:  
  \[
  \frac{\partial \Psi_{\text{loc}}}{\partial d} = \frac{\partial \Psi_{\text{elastic}}}{\partial d} + \frac{\partial \Psi_{\text{fracture}}}{\partial d} + \frac{\partial \Psi_{\text{other}}}{\partial d}
  \]
  where \(\Psi_{\text{other}}\) may represent additional physics such as thermal energy (\(\Psi_{\text{thermal}}\)) or fluid energy (\(\Psi_{\text{fluid}}\)) in porous flow systems.
  However, in a physical sense, thermally induced fracture arises primarily from the <strong>thermal stress</strong>, not from the temperature itself. As a result, it is common practice to <strong>exclude</strong> \(\Psi_{\text{thermal}}\) from the governing phase-field equation.  
  Instead, temperature-dependent material parameters (e.g., conductivity in the present case) are coupled with the damage variable \(d\), capturing the thermal effects indirectly but effectively.
</p>

    <p>⚠️ <strong>Note 2:</strong> While using loosely coupled systems may compromise accuracy, extra care on convergence criteria is required.  
      In this case, the nonlinear residual tolerance is set to \( 1 \times 10^{-7} \).
