    <p>
        I’ve been wanting to test out the <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0020768324005298" target="_blank"><strong>Finite-epsilon model</strong></a> by implementing it in an open-source framework and running it myself.
        In <strong>phase-field fracture mechanics</strong>, material failure is typically represented by introducing a damage variable \( d \) into a diffusion equation.
        To differentiate between <strong>tensile and shear failure</strong>, a common approach is to extract part of the elastic strain energy to drive the evolution of \( d \).
    </p>
    
    <p>
        However, many traditional decomposition methods—such as <strong>stress deviatoric decomposition</strong> and <strong>stress spectral decomposition</strong>—struggle with convergence, particularly under <strong>uniaxial compression</strong>.
        In these cases, residual errors persist, forcing the time step size to drop to extreme levels (as low as <strong>\(1e-8\)</strong>).
        Even with <strong>all 16 cores</strong> of my personal computer running, the simulation barely progressed <strong>2 mm in two days</strong>.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        While literature offers numerous alternative energy split methods, most come with significant trade-offs.
        Some <em>lack mathematical rigor</em>, while others are so complex that implementing them requires dealing with <strong>excessive if-else conditions</strong>,
        making the code unwieldy and prone to <strong>numerical instability</strong>.
        Many of these approaches feel more like quick-fix solutions aimed at boosting publication counts rather than well-founded models.
    
    
    <p>
        In contrast, the <strong>Finite-epsilon model</strong> is the only one that successfully ran to completion in my tests. 🎯
