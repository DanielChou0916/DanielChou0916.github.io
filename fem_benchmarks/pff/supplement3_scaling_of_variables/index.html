    <h2>🚀 Diversity of Residual</h2>
    <p>
        In multi-physics systems, multiple governing equations with their corresponding primary variables are solved simultaneously. Due to differences in scale and physical nature, 
        the residual magnitudes of these variables often vary significantly.
    </p>

    <p>
      In this example, a <a href="https://danielchou0916.github.io/fem_benchmarks/pff/">hydraulic fracture test</a> is performed.  
      The simulation couples three physical processes: phase-field fracture, mechanical equilibrium (momentum balance), and pore pressure diffusion (fluid conservation in porous media).  
      In 2D, there are four primary variables: phase-field damage \( d \), displacements \( u_x \) and \( u_y \), and pore pressure \( p_w \).  
      Three cases are compared:<br>
      <strong>-No scaling</strong><br>
      <strong>-Auto-scaling</strong><br>
      <strong>-Manual scaling</strong> with \( d = 5 \times 10^{-3} \), \( u_x, u_y = 1 \times 10^{-4} \), and \( p_w = 1 \times 10^{-5} \).

      ✅ <strong>The auto-scaling option in MOOSE was also tested. While the GIF is not shown here, the performance was similarly poor as in the no-scaling case.</strong><br>
      ✅ <strong>In both the no-scaling and auto-scaling scenarios, the time step size drops to around \(10^{-7}\) to \(10^{-8}\), making the computation painfully slow. While it technically "converges," it's so time-consuming that the simulation becomes useless in practice.</strong><br>
      ✅ <strong>In contrast, the manually tuned scaling case successfully continues past 35 seconds, with visible crack propagation, demonstrating acceptable convergence.</strong>

    <h2>❓ How to Determine Variable Scaling</h2>
    <p>  
      ✅ <strong>1. Set <code>show_var_residual_norms = true</code> in the <code>[Debug]</code> block of your input file.</strong><br>
      ✅ <strong>2. Limit steps for testing by setting <code>num_steps = 3</code>.</strong><br>
      ✅ <strong>3. Run the simulation and examine the residuals of each variable printed in the terminal.</strong><br>
      ✅ <strong>4. Adjust scaling values accordingly.</strong><br>
      ✅ <strong>5. Repeat the above steps until convergence behavior improves.</strong><br><br>
      🔎 <strong>Note:</strong> Avoid setting the scale of the phase-field variable \( d \) too low, as it may prevent damage from evolving. Start with a scale of 1 and reduce only if convergence issues arise. 
      If issues persist, double-check your material properties and boundary conditions.
